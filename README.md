I implemented a  game that was inspired by the app “Flappy Bird.” The game is played by controlling a main player with the spacebar and then having the player go through as many warp pipes as it can. If the player touches one of the warp pipes, then the game finishes. In other words, the goal of the game is to avoid touching the warp pipes that are coming to the player and reach the highest score a user can achieve.
